      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I have understood quickly that if I am not studying anymore I will be outperformed by others and that it will be complicated to keep a level of understanding to keep working in companies. Building home labs with PFsense, proxy servers, load balancers, and experimenting with certificates and stress tests. The goal of this project is to gain some skills into Linux servers and proxy usage.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Cloudflare" class="sub-project">
      <h3>Cloudflare</h3>
      <p>
        To have a proper website and a certificate, HTTPS and a secured tunnel I have decided to use Cloudflare.<br><br>
        First I have bought a domain name : cyber-corp.org. Next I have configured the tunnel between my machine and Cloudflare. 
        In this section I will show you how I have achieved to do that.
      </p>

          <figcaption>Here you have the connector for the Cloudflare tunnel. It will be a docker installed in the server where you have your website or your server cluster.</figcaption>

          <img src="Pictures/step5.png" alt="Cloudflare tunnel connector route">
          <figcaption>Here there is the route connector that will allow to publish my website without exposing my private IP. Also the website will be reachable with my official domain name that I have bought at Cloudflare.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <br><p>
        Now that I have finished to create my tunnel we have to create some policies 
        and manage the access to this website
      </p>

      <div class="photo-grid">
        <figure>

          <img src="Pictures/Step7.png" alt="Policy assignment screenshot">
          <figcaption> Here I am defining the Policy that I will apply to my website. For exemple here I have setup the acces to be allowed and the session to have 24 hour lifespan. The authentication methode will be a pin code for the simplicity of the situation. There is many other options like email authentication. I just have to add the authorized emails and they will receive a confirmation in their mailbox.</figcaption>

          <img src="Pictures/Step7bis.png" alt="Access management screenshot">
          <figcaption> This is the alternate solution that I have to control the access of my website, with an email logon</figcaption>

          <figcaption> When finished creating the policy, you will land here where there is the recap of all the policies created.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <br><p>
        Now that I have finished to create my acces policy I have to create my application in Cloudflare
      </p>
